## Description

This is supplementary material for my master's thesis "INVESTIGATING OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF BANKS 
WITH NETWORK THEORY USING BANKSCOPE DATABASE 2003-2013". Graph rendering in the thesis were created 
by taking screenshots from this interactive panel. It shows the ownership network, which is a dynamic graph 
built from data for the period of 2003-2013 provided by Bankscope database. Three derivative graphs were 
produced from this data by using block modeling (see menu on the left). This panel can resize nodes and links by different values and can also animate graph states through the observed period.
